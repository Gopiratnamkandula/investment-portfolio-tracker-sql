# 💼 Investment Portfolio Tracker (SQL Project)

This project is a basic Investment Portfolio Tracker built using **SQLite**. It helps simulate how investors track their stock holdings, prices, and transactions over time. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate fundamental SQL skills such as creating schema, inserting data, and querying data to extract insights.
